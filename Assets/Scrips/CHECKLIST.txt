Things to check before compiling:
    1 Check under Edit->Project settings -> Player -> Resolution and presentation
      that "Run in background" is enabled and "Display resolution dialog" is disabled
    2 Check under Edit->Project settings -> Player -> Other settings that
      App Compatibility Level is set to .Net 4.x
    3 IMPORTANT: Check that Actions are Discrete with 2 branches of size 11 and 3
    4 IMPORTANT: The timescale and fixed update step are set in the code, in CarAgent.Start()


How to run the training:
    With mlagents-learn:
        1. Compile the scene by going to File -> Build Settings, check that the main (car) scene is selected (otherwise
                select it by clicking on "Add Open Scenes"), select your platform, and click build.
        2. Save the build files (both the executable and the data folder) NOT inside the Assets folder
        3. Edit the training file in configs/ as you prefer (follow github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-PPO.md)
           or github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-SAC.md
        4. Run mlagents-learn configs/<training conf file> --env=<path to binary> --no-graphics --train
            4.1 If you want to see something, remove --no-graphics. If you want to see tensorboard plots, run tensorboard --logdir=summaries
    With python:
        1. Open python~/train_unity.py and modify the path to the binary with your path
        2. Run the python script
